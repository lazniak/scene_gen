**Prompt:**

> Create a humorous, 90s-style educational music video tutorial featuring a stereotypical "computer geek" character.
>
> **The Character ("The User"):**
> A young man with thick, oversized glasses, slicked-back hair, wearing a plaid shirt tucked tightly into high-waisted beige trousers pulled up to his stomach. He has a pocket protector and looks enthusiastically awkward.
>
> **Setting & Visuals:**
> The video takes place in a retro 90s bedroom/computer lab with beige CRT monitors. However, the screens on these monitors MUST display the **provided reference images** (Screenshots of GitHub, ComfyUI, the Scene Gen plugin, and Replicate interface).
>
> **Action Sequence:**
> 1.  **Intro:** The Geek stands next to a CRT monitor, rapping to the camera and pointing at the screen which shows the **GitHub page** (Reference Image). He looks excited about the "new code".
> 2.  **The Process:** Cut to the Geek sitting at the computer, typing furiously. The screen zooms in to show the **ComfyUI interface** (Reference Image). He is physically "connecting" the nodes with exaggerated hand movements, like a conductor.
> 3.  **The Magic:** He points to the **Scene Gen node** (Reference Image) on the screen. It glows or pulses. He wipes sweat from his forehead.
> 4.  **The Result:** He stands up and dances awkwardly as the screen shows the **Replicate interface** (Reference Image) generating video.
>
> **Style & Aesthetic:**
> -   **Vibe:** "Nerdcore" Hip-Hop / 90s Educational VHS.
> -   **Camera:** Static shots, slightly grainy "home video" texture, cheesy zoom-ins on the software interfaces.
> -   **Lighting:** Flat, bright sitcom-style lighting.
>
> **Instruction for AI:** Use the provided reference images as the actual content on the computer screens or background projections. The Geek interacts directly with these tools, treating them as the "stars" of the show.
