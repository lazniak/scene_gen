## Lyrics

[Intro]
(Vinyl crackle)
Yo, yo, check the levels.
Microphone check one, two.
We talkin' 'bout Scene Gen today.
ComfyUI revolution.
Listen close, class is in session!

[Verse 1]
First thing first, drag the node on the screen
The dopest custom node that you ever seen
Hook up your audio, yeah that .wav file
We bout to generate a video with style
You need that Gemini Key, paste it in the slot
And the Replicate Token, give it all you got
Connect the wires, yeah, make the flow complete
Now watch the AI start dissectin' the beat

[Chorus]
Scene Gen! (What?) Makin' movies from the noise
Scene Gen! (Yeah!) For the girls and the boys
It listens to the track, then it paints the view
From Gemini to Replicate, it does it all for you
Scene Gen! (Uh-huh) Automatic video flow
Just press queue prompt and watch the magic go!

[Verse 2]
Stage One, it analyzes the genre and the mood
Is it funky, is it sad, is it rude?
Stage Two, definin' style, cyberpunk or noir
Stage Three, pickin' colors, raisin' up the bar!
Then comes Stage Four, assets generated
Actors and environments, fully automated
If you got your own pics, throw 'em in the mix
Reference Analysis gonna learn your tricks!

[Bridge]
(Scratching sound)
Wiki-wiki-wait!
We ain't done yet!
We gotta make it move!

[Verse 3]
Stage Five is the Montage, cuttin' up the time
Matchin' every second to the rhythm and the rhyme
Wan, Kling, Hailuo, or maybe Veo 3
Pick your video model, set the pixels free!
Stage Ten, Replicate is renderin' the clips
While you sit back and sip, hand on your hips
Stage Eleven, stitch it up, ffmpeg the glue
Final output ready, comin' straight to you!

[Outro]
Yeah.
That's how we do it in ComfyUI.
Scene Gen node.
Check the output folder.
We out.
(Fade out with beat)
